    description: "A motion tracking system that utilizes a webcam and a computer vision algorithm to accurately track the position of an object undergoing planar motion as a function of time. The ultimate goal of our project is to create a completely self contained open-source system that educators can use to help students explore one dimensional motion in a physics lab setting. ",
